# HW1_Bluescape

### Task

Implement a simple QML-based UI with a label and a button, similar to the one in the attached screenshot.

![Expected Result](https://github.com/pauligb/HW1_Bluescape/blob/master/expected.png)

### Requirements

- [x] Load a list of words from file on disk.
- [x] Main label should display a random word each time the button is clicked.
- [x] Words should be transfered using Qtâ€™s C++ - QML bridging support.
- [x] Add main text horizontal centered.
- [x] Window background should tile.
- [x] Button horizontal aligned with the window.
- [x] Button aligned at the bottom - With a specific bottom margin.
- [x] Logo aligned top-right corner from window.


### Bonus points

- [ ] Add function in Javascript to change the color of the label to a new random color when the button is clicked.
- [ ] Make the color of the text fade smoothly to the new color.
- [ ] Button scales horizontally with the window.
- [x] Button corners should not appear stretched.

### Evaluation

We will be testing it on an unspecified OS using Qt 5.13.
I recommend sticking to qmake for the build system, but cmake is ok too if you have a preference for it.
Make sure your code builds and runs out of the box, including the loading of the sample words file.
